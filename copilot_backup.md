# Copilot Chat Backup Strategy

## Problem
- Copilot spends time summarizing conversations
- All context lost when VS Code closes
- No way to restore previous sessions

## Manual Backup Workflow

Before important Copilot sessions:
1. Copy conversation to this file
2. Note key decisions and code changes
3. Use Claude/MCP for continuation

## Key Points from Previous Sessions
- [Date]: Brief summary of important decisions
- [Date]: Code patterns discovered
- [Date]: Architecture insights

## Code Snippets Worth Preserving
```language
// Important code from Copilot sessions
```

## Next Session Context
- What we were working on
- Current state of implementation
- Next steps planned
