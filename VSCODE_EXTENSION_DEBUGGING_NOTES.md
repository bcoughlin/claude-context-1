# VS Code Extension Debugging Session Notes
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Project:** claude-context-fork  
**Issue:** Extension activation and command registration failures

## Problem Summary
The Vector Memory VS Code extension has fundamental command registration issues preventing proper functionality, despite successful XMLHttpRequest compatibility fixes.

## Issues Resolved ✅
1. **XMLHttpRequest Compatibility**: Successfully removed all XMLHttpRequest references from NetworkInterceptor class
   - **File**: `packages/vscode-extension/src/monitoring/networkInterceptor.ts`
   - **Change**: Converted to fetch-only architecture for Node.js compatibility
   - **Result**: No more "XMLHttpRequest is not defined" errors

2. **Extension Building**: Extension builds successfully with webpack
   - **Result**: Clean builds, no compilation errors

3. **Extension Installation**: VSIX packaging and installation works
   - **Result**: Extension appears in VS Code Extensions panel

## Critical Issues Remaining ❌
1. **Command Registration Failure**
   - **Error**: `command 'claude-context.toggleNetworkInterception' not found`
   - **Status**: VS Code cannot discover any of the extension commands
   - **Impact**: Extension appears installed but no functionality is accessible

## Technical Analysis
- **Package.json**: Contains proper command definitions in `contributes.commands`
- **Extension.ts**: Registers commands using `vscode.commands.registerCommand()`
- **Build Process**: Webpack bundles successfully
- **Installation**: VSIX installs without errors
- **Runtime**: Commands not found by VS Code Command Palette

## Files Modified
1. `packages/vscode-extension/src/monitoring/networkInterceptor.ts`
   - Removed: `originalXHROpen`, `createXHRInterceptor()`, `processXHRResponse()`
   - Kept: `createFetchInterceptor()` only

2. `packages/vscode-extension/package.json`
   - Added: Complete command definitions for all registered commands
   - Updated: Category from "Vector Memory" to "Claude Context"

## Next Steps for Future Debugging
1. **Investigation Areas**:
   - Extension activation lifecycle (`activate()` function execution)
   - Webpack bundle analysis (verify extension.ts is included)
   - Extension host environment debugging
   - Command registration timing issues

2. **Debugging Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Check extension installation
   code --list-extensions | grep vector
   
   # Build extension
   cd packages/vscode-extension
   webpack --mode development
   
   # Create VSIX
   mkdir -p manual-vsix/extension
   cp package.json manual-vsix/extension/
   cp -r src manual-vsix/extension/
   cd manual-vsix && zip -r ../extension.vsix .
   ```

3. **VS Code Debugging**:
   - Check Developer Tools Console for activation errors
   - Verify extension appears in Running Extensions view
   - Test with Extension Development Host (F5) for better error visibility

## Architecture Notes
- **NetworkInterceptor**: Now exclusively uses `globalThis.fetch` interception
- **Token Monitoring**: Designed to track API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot
- **MCP Integration**: Extension connects to conversation memory system
- **Build Target**: Node.js environment (not browser)

## Code Quality Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No XMLHttpRequest browser API dependencies
- ✅ Proper Node.js compatibility
- ❌ Runtime command registration broken

## Switching Projects Note
**Reason for pause**: Command registration issue appears to be a fundamental VS Code extension lifecycle problem that requires deeper investigation into the extension activation process. The XMLHttpRequest compatibility work was successful, but the extension cannot be functionally tested until commands are properly registered.

**Recommendation**: Focus on extension activation debugging in future sessions, potentially using VS Code Extension Development Host for better error visibility.
